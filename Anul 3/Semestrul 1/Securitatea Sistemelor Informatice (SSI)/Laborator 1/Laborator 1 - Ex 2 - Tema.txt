Main Ideas:

- You have to think how to make systems fail
- It's good to think how you could overcome the security of various systems around you everyday, even if doing so would be illegal. This mindset sits at the center of security.
- You'll learn a lot of things by "hacking" your devices but you'll gain even more knowledge by trying to do the same thing to a foreign device
- Expertise in security is in high demand but low supply.
